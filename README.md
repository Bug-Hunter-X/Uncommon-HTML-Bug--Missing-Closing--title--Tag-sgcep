# Uncommon HTML Bug: Missing Closing <title> Tag

This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic bug in HTML: a missing closing `</title>` tag.  While many missing tags will result in obvious rendering issues, a missing closing `<title>` tag might only surface as a validation error or unexpected behavior in certain environments.

## The Bug

The `bug.html` file contains a missing closing tag for the `<title>` element. This can lead to unpredictable behavior or errors, depending on the browser or validation tools used.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file provides the corrected version with the closing `</title>` tag added.  This ensures proper validation and consistent rendering across different browsers.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `bug.html` in a web browser.  Observe any unexpected behavior (may be subtle).
3.  Open `bugSolution.html` and compare the result.
